# ProcessScheduler
this repo is for the operating sytems cse project, "processes scheduler".

the project resembles the operating system in CPU scheduling
where the user is prompted to choose no of processes and scheduling algorithm
whether it's 
  1) first come first served
  2) shortest job first
  3) round robbin
      where each process takes the processor for a quantum of time
  4) priority
  
then processes are scheduled and drawn on a gantt chart with different lengths resembling different burst times.

Python3 and PyQt5 are used for the GUI application.
